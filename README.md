# Hey there! 👋

I'm Rohit, a B.Sc. IT grad who loves playing around with data and building things that actually work.

Right now I'm knee-deep in data science projects and picking up new tech as I go. Always down for a good hackathon or competition – nothing beats the rush of solving problems under pressure.

## What I'm up to

Working on personal projects that combine data analysis with machine learning. Some work out great, some teach me what *not* to do next time. Either way, I'm learning.

If you're into data science, ML, or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out!
